## Loading, setting up

To get started, let's load the required packages. Click the green arrow at the top right of the "code chunk" below:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)

library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's see if we can work with one of the datasets included with the {tidyverse}. Click the green arrow at the top right of the "code chunk" below:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()
```

If you saw a plot, congratulations! Things are working just fine.

Reflect for a moment: **What do you notice about this plot? What do you wonder?**

Now, let's look at the full dataset we will use: descriptions of *Star Wars* characters. Click the green arrow again.

```{r}
starwars
```

## Selecting variables

Let's `select` (i.e., look at) only a few variables that we're interested in.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, sex, homeworld)
```

**Try it out!**

Now try to *include one additional variable* in your `select()` function. 

First, combine the `names()` function (which lists all the variable names in a dateset) and our dataset, `starwars`.

```{r}

```

Then, add a new variable to the code below after percentage_earned, being careful to type the new variable name as it appears in the dataset. 

When you're ready, click the green arrow to view the result.

If you add to this code, change the chunk option `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE`! Then, hit "Knit" above to recreate your PDF report with this new information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height, sex, homeworld, )
```

## Filtering variables

Next, let's explore filtering variables. That is, the `filter()` function allows us to only view observations of a variable when the parameters we define are met.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "female")
```

What do you think will happen if we add another condition to the `filter()` statement?

**Try it out!**

Be sure to run the result to see whether `filter()` did what you think it should do.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "female",
         height > 172)
```

Perhaps you remember from looking at the `starwars` data a moment ago that Luke Skywalker's height is 172. What, then, can you conclude from the data you've just filtered?

## Creating a plot with {ggplot2}

What do you think this code will do?

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

**Try it out!**

Now, add `mass` to the code below as the variable that will correspond to the *y*-axis. 

Notice that instead of using `geom_density()`, we're using `geom_point()`. What do you think this will create?

Be sure to run the code chunk to see the result.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

**What do you notice about this plot? What do you wonder?**

Which Star Wars character do you think is represented by that outlier point?

## Visualizing a larger dataset (leap challenge)

- Can you filter or select variables from the `mpg` (automobile fuel economy, or miles-per-gallon) dataset below?
- Can you select a smaller number of variables from the `mpg` dataset below?

If you add to this code, change the chunk option `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE`. Then, hit "Knit" again to recreate your PDF report with this new information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mpg


```

Now try to create a simple plot with the `mpg` dataset. Again, be sure to change the chunk option `eval=FALSE` to `eval=TRUE`. Then, hit "Knit" again to recreate your PDF report with this new information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot() +

  
```
