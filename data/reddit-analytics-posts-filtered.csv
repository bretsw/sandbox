I just started a BA role in a LATAM-based fintech, specifically a BNPL/eCommerce.   
After the onboarding I was suggested by my manager to own retention and engagement as a first project.   


This is because there is no alignment in how should we measure retention consistently (definitions vary) as well as how to report it in order to share insights. Also, that there are initiatives and efforts from several teams (Growth, Marketing, Credit & Risk, etc) which involve A/B testing but there is no consistency in the methodology that each team use.

2023-01-30T22:17:08Z,r/analytics,10pfveg,NA,I believe Scrum/Agile is worthless for data analytics,"Last friday I approached my boss (I am comfortable comunicating anything with him)
and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

I want to help him organizing it. The team is already 20, which I believe is too many already for a startup fintech. We went 400 to 600 in less than a year. I smell lay offs...

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

So, I began to explore other options. In about six weeks, I managed to complete the Coursera Professional Certification.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

The UA code is in the headers n footers plugin.

On Jan 21 I finally added GA4. I installed Monsterinsights (I did not download the plugin. I used the version you install quickly in WP).

I made 2 errors. I forgot to paste the GA4 tracking code in WP. And 2, I didnt check realtime if it worked. I just assumed it did.

When I checked GA4 and UA hours later, there was no data. I checked headers n footers and the UA code was gone.

I removed monsterinsights and copied the UA & GA4 code into headers n footers.

Next day UA showed only 548 pviews. The day after it was 224.

In GA4 it is 560 pageviews.

I looked in Google Console. No penalties and my clicks and impressions didnt change.

How do I fix this? Do I remove both codes and use Tag Manager instead?

Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

Currently the  team downloads these data manually and process them, but I will mainly  help them build an automated pipeline process and feed them to my ML  models. I only have experience on data analytics stuff on Python, and I  am not entirely sure how can I set up an infrastructure at the company.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

I  was thinking about a centralised system, like building a LAN server  that runs 24/7 Python scripts pulling daily data from different APIs to  feed them directly into my models, and create reports on excel which the  team can just download them. There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

2023-01-30T22:17:08Z,r/analytics,10pfveg,NA,I believe Scrum/Agile is worthless for data analytics,"Last friday I approached my boss (I am comfortable comunicating anything with him)
and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

I want to help him organizing it. The team is already 20, which I believe is too many already for a startup fintech. We went 400 to 600 in less than a year. I smell lay offs...

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

2023-01-30T02:21:25Z,r/analytics,10oq2bt,NA,Does GTM load all tags in a pageview even if they are not assigned to trigger?,"In a discussion with another person, he had some concerns about the tags, triggers, and variables I added saying it would increase the loading time and he had concerns with page speed.  


I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

So I'm working for an HR startup that does satisfaction audits every year. It's a fairly new one and I feel like the way the survey is structured isn't fully fleshed out.

To cut a long story short, my boss wants me to do a YOY analysis on the results but the number of respondents increases as the companies scale up (e.g., Year 1 - 17 people participated in the survey then Year 2 - 25 people participated in the survey). This vastly affects the interpretation (i.g., decrease in satisfaction is influenced by the increase in respondents) however I am unsure on how to approach it differently.

I feel like I’m not doing anything related to Data Analytics, no sql no python, I’m learning alteryx and Visio but I haven’t really worked with them for client use. It’s been about 5 months since I started & all in all I’m really just stuck and unhappy with my current role.

I’ve always been interested in banking but never really pursued it. I think I want to now. What sort of skills do banks like JPMorgan, Goldman, and Citi look for when it comes to data analyst or ppl who like working with data and storytelling.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on how to take process to the next part of this would be very helpful.

and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

Ultimately, I think I would be interested in going the Data Science route if at all possible.

My formal training was in Chemical Engineering, but I've lost touch with a lot of the stuff after not having done it for over a decade. 

In my last role, I had two main responsibilities.  One was to manage a small team of Business English and TOEFL trainers, and another part was running the IT Help Desk (nothing too big there - mainly stuff like software licenses, ordering new parts, resetting passwords, laptop overheating, etc.).  I did not find this terribly exciting, and what's more, is that I could see the writing on the wall a few weeks ago that my contract woudldn't get renewed.

So, I began to explore other options. In about six weeks, I managed to complete the Coursera Professional Certification. As I had already some programming and mathematical background (I taught computer science and helped administer the independent study program at a private school stateside), I didn't find the technical part to be that taxing. The new skills I learned were mainly Tableau and R - although it wasn't a deep dive by any means.  I previously had experience with Python, and tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and so on.

Naturally, I know that this is only a crash course and there is more to be done before I can find a job. I am just not sure about next steps.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

2023-01-22T15:12:26Z,r/analytics,10iltbh,NA,Creating a brand new data infrastructure for a small company,"I  recently applied for a data science role at a small marketing agency.  Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

Currently the  team downloads these data manually and process them, but I will mainly  help them build an automated pipeline process and feed them to my ML  models. I only have experience on data analytics stuff on Python, and I  am not entirely sure how can I set up an infrastructure at the company.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

I  was thinking about a centralised system, like building a LAN server  that runs 24/7 Python scripts pulling daily data from different APIs to  feed them directly into my models, and create reports on excel which the  team can just download them. There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

What do you think would be the best solution and is there any tips that you might have?",3,3,3,0,1,/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/,2023-01-22,2023,remaining,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/

2023-01-30T22:17:08Z,r/analytics,10pfveg,NA,I believe Scrum/Agile is worthless for data analytics,"Last friday I approached my boss (I am comfortable comunicating anything with him)
and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

I want to help him organizing it. The team is already 20, which I believe is too many already for a startup fintech. We went 400 to 600 in less than a year. I smell lay offs...

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.

I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

So I'm working for an HR startup that does satisfaction audits every year. It's a fairly new one and I feel like the way the survey is structured isn't fully fleshed out.

To cut a long story short, my boss wants me to do a YOY analysis on the results but the number of respondents increases as the companies scale up (e.g., Year 1 - 17 people participated in the survey then Year 2 - 25 people participated in the survey). This vastly affects the interpretation (i.g., decrease in satisfaction is influenced by the increase in respondents) however I am unsure on how to approach it differently.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

One was to manage a small team of Business English and TOEFL trainers, and another part was running the IT Help Desk (nothing too big there - mainly stuff like software licenses, ordering new parts, resetting passwords, laptop overheating, etc.).  I did not find this terribly exciting, and what's more, is that I could see the writing on the wall a few weeks ago that my contract woudldn't get renewed.

So, I began to explore other options. In about six weeks, I managed to complete the Coursera Professional Certification. As I had already some programming and mathematical background (I taught computer science and helped administer the independent study program at a private school stateside), I didn't find the technical part to be that taxing. The new skills I learned were mainly Tableau and R - although it wasn't a deep dive by any means.  I previously had experience with Python, and tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and so on.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on how to take process to the next part of this would be very helpful.

Yet now I’m studying for SQL technical interviews where they ask for niche things that would be easier to just grab from an ongoing dashboard—not to mention easier to validate that you did everything correctly.

E.g. a classic one is “pull the -second- highest spending customer”…but really, I’d rather just see all of the top customers in a BI chart where I can easily see this second highest spending customer in addition to the others, without having to customize the query for that specific question.

It just doesn’t seem realistic to be writing out every single question exactly as a query, but that’s what SQL technicals appear to be trying to emulate. Who actually works like this?

Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

I  was thinking about a centralised system, like building a LAN server  that runs 24/7 Python scripts pulling daily data from different APIs to  feed them directly into my models, and create reports on excel which the  team can just download them. There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on how to take process to the next part of this would be very helpful.

Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

I just started a BA role in a LATAM-based fintech, specifically a BNPL/eCommerce.   
After the onboarding I was suggested by my manager to own retention and engagement as a first project.   


This is because there is no alignment in how should we measure retention consistently (definitions vary) as well as how to report it in order to share insights. Also, that there are initiatives and efforts from several teams (Growth, Marketing, Credit & Risk, etc) which involve A/B testing but there is no consistency in the methodology that each team use.

2023-01-30T22:17:08Z,r/analytics,10pfveg,NA,I believe Scrum/Agile is worthless for data analytics,"Last friday I approached my boss (I am comfortable comunicating anything with him)
and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

I want to help him organizing it. The team is already 20, which I believe is too many already for a startup fintech. We went 400 to 600 in less than a year. I smell lay offs...

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.

I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

So, I began to explore other options. In about six weeks, I managed to complete the Coursera Professional Certification.

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

Next day UA showed only 548 pviews. The day after it was 224.

In GA4 it is 560 pageviews.

I looked in Google Console. No penalties and my clicks and impressions didnt change.

How do I fix this? Do I remove both codes and use Tag Manager instead?

Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

Currently the  team downloads these data manually and process them, but I will mainly  help them build an automated pipeline process and feed them to my ML  models. I only have experience on data analytics stuff on Python, and I  am not entirely sure how can I set up an infrastructure at the company.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

I  was thinking about a centralised system, like building a LAN server  that runs 24/7 Python scripts pulling daily data from different APIs to  feed them directly into my models, and create reports on excel which the  team can just download them. There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

2023-01-30T22:17:08Z,r/analytics,10pfveg,NA,I believe Scrum/Agile is worthless for data analytics,"Last friday I approached my boss (I am comfortable comunicating anything with him)
and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

I want to help him organizing it. The team is already 20, which I believe is too many already for a startup fintech. We went 400 to 600 in less than a year. I smell lay offs...

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

2023-01-30T02:21:25Z,r/analytics,10oq2bt,NA,Does GTM load all tags in a pageview even if they are not assigned to trigger?,"In a discussion with another person, he had some concerns about the tags, triggers, and variables I added saying it would increase the loading time and he had concerns with page speed.  


I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

So I'm working for an HR startup that does satisfaction audits every year. It's a fairly new one and I feel like the way the survey is structured isn't fully fleshed out.

This vastly affects the interpretation (i.g., decrease in satisfaction is influenced by the increase in respondents) however I am unsure on how to approach it differently.

The new skills I learned were mainly Tableau and R - although it wasn't a deep dive by any means.  I previously had experience with Python, and tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and so on.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on how to take process to the next part of this would be very helpful.

Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

and I said that we should evolve how the data team is organized.

I am one of the most experienced in the team, and I noticed that doing ""sprints"" doesnt make sense because there are no follow-up on this. If I dont finish a card I just move to the next sprint.

Also, 2023 Q4 our team was split in a new concept. Everyone of us would be assigned to business units squads. So everybody is doing different projects in daily basis. Excepcionally special demands my boss can gather a few of us to deal with them.

Yet we keep doing dailys and sprint reviews within ourselves.
Just to join the actual daily and sprint review with the business unit I am assigned.

For me it doesnt make sense all the ""sprintception"".

I could not care less about what my coworkers are doing in daily basis. There were never a productive daily where a duplicate demand was dismantled on site or helpful information at all.

If I have a doubt I just go to the person that might know.

For me the dailys are a distraction and a waste of time. Another colleague said the same thing.

Boss said the problem is having a track of how much the team is performing. He is doing the data stewardness and need to explain why the team has grown lately. 

I just said that the only useful in scrum thing is the Kanban. And that he could track activies just by counting them per person. The later falls on value vs quantity. Its kinda subjective to measure success in data analytics.

Regarding data knowledge among us I believe a weekly meetings where anyone that wants to show something has 2 minutes to speak freely about their work would be more objective and comfortable. Afterall some days are gains other days  are unfinished jobs.

2023-01-30T15:56:19Z,r/analytics,10p69zf,NA,Analytics Management Question - Poor performing junior analyst - I'm picking up slack. Need advice.,"I'm a manager of analytics at my company and I used to have a Junior Marketing Analyst working under me, but the scope of my role changed and I no longer have her as a report, but I work on broad corporate analytics (all functions).

When she was hired, I was not a part of the process, however, I did know who this person was and knew her capabilities were lacking. I told the hiring manager not to hire her for this role, but if he insisted I would make it work. 

So of course he only heard ""hire her, I would make it work"" out of my mouth. 

I worked hard to get her up to speed on the very basics of Pivot Tables and Query management via Power Query. She was very slow to develop any autonomy, but I taught her and challenged her to think through her problems and solve them. She eventually gained autonomy, but I knew she was not going to advance her analytics skills without significant intervention from a better teacher than me.

By the time I left the team, I was confident that while she would experience bumps in the road, she would at least be able to not need any hand holding.

***

Narrator: ""She constantly needed hand-holding""

In my current role, I'm often asked to occasionally consult on marketing analytics. My scope is corporate-wide, so this falls well within what I'm supposed to be doing. 

The junior analyst is not performing well whatsoever. It's as if she forgot everything that she knew only a few months ago. Basic stuff like dealing with a misnamed column in a query is crippling her work and she's constantly asking me to help. This is stuff she demonstrated that she knew only a few months ago.

***

**How do I deal with this?** here are my other key concerns about what's going on:

- Her problems take up a great deal of my time which should be better focused on bigger, corporate problems. I'm happy to make sure projects get over the finish line, but these are not my projects - they belong to her. 
 - If one of her projects don't get over the finish line or it's close to crunch time, it will either reflect poorly on me since I didn't help out, or I will be requested to drop everything to get the work finished. Again, I'm not accountable nor responsible for much of this work.
- Her manager (my former manager) I believe is aware that I'm doing this, so my work isn't all for nothing, but I don't need more accolades from him. 
- My current manager is not managing me. He's got two challenges;
 - He was promoted from his old role but the company is slow to shift his old work away. He's neck-deep in stuff, but luckily, his manager as well as the COO are active in managing me. I'm confident that within a few weeks he will be able to actively manage me.
 - He is the only director leading this broad a team both in size and functional scope. His power to go up against my old boss (a VP) is going to be limited. So I'm not sure who wins in a conflict unless we have COO backing.
- This one seems petty but I'll mention it anyway because it's valid: Every year there's a sales and marketing conference in Florida. I was told I wouldn't be needed this year.  Despite this, I'm being asked to provide all the support so the junior analyst can go. I don't mind not going, but I certainly don't feel that it's appropriate that I perform the work of someone who's able to go, yet I cannot.
 - Also recall that the Jr. Analyst is being crippled by basic stuff. Her work is not going to get done unless I intervene constantly (and basically do her work for her).

***

I don't want to do something that significantly impacts her career negatively (dismissal) because:

- It makes me look like a poor manager even though she was a high performer within the scope of her role when I was supervising her
- If she goes, I'm suddenly forced to pick up all the slack, not growing my role, and I'm not confident that I'll have any more than a 1-hour interview in terms of supporting the search for a new candidate. 
- I know I wouldn't necessarily be responsible for the loss of her job, but it would sure as shit feel like it for a while.

I told him that they do not trigger on all pages. They only fire in specific situations.  


Then he tells me even though, the whole container loads when the page loads.  


I do not believe this is true. The reason you would want to use GTM instead of building your own massive JavaScript library aside from the convenience is the full control of what loads and when. Even if you have 10,000 tags in your container if the triggers are designed to not load on a pageview, then it will not be included in what GTM will fetch and load on a page. GTM is on a server you connect to, so it preprocesses the code to only contain what it needs, and sends it over to the page to load.  


If I am correct if you could share an official Google page that mentions this would help me convince the person that GTM does not work that way. But obviously, if I am wrong, an official Google page that mentions this will help convince me.

Ultimately, I think I would be interested in going the Data Science route if at all possible.

My formal training was in Chemical Engineering, but I've lost touch with a lot of the stuff after not having done it for over a decade. 

In my last role, I had two main responsibilities.  One was to manage a small team of Business English and TOEFL trainers, and another part was running the IT Help Desk (nothing too big there - mainly stuff like software licenses, ordering new parts, resetting passwords, laptop overheating, etc.).  I did not find this terribly exciting, and what's more, is that I could see the writing on the wall a few weeks ago that my contract woudldn't get renewed.

So, I began to explore other options. In about six weeks, I managed to complete the Coursera Professional Certification. As I had already some programming and mathematical background (I taught computer science and helped administer the independent study program at a private school stateside), I didn't find the technical part to be that taxing. The new skills I learned were mainly Tableau and R - although it wasn't a deep dive by any means.  I previously had experience with Python, and tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and so on.

Naturally, I know that this is only a crash course and there is more to be done before I can find a job. I am just not sure about next steps.

2023-01-24T16:13:25Z,r/analytics,10k921a,NA,How to show statistical significance of rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, amongst others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

2023-01-22T15:12:26Z,r/analytics,10iltbh,NA,Creating a brand new data infrastructure for a small company,"I  recently applied for a data science role at a small marketing agency.  Based on conversations with the CEO and some of the staff it seems that I  will also be responsible in setting up a data infrastucture for the  company as well (my official role is apparently Data Engineering  Assistant).

The data that we will  use come from  social media APIs such as Google Analytics to monitor the  clients' social media page and posts to build a report and to monitor  our ad performance.

Currently the  team downloads these data manually and process them, but I will mainly  help them build an automated pipeline process and feed them to my ML  models. I only have experience on data analytics stuff on Python, and I  am not entirely sure how can I set up an infrastructure at the company.

I  have built a script that automatically pulls data from Google Analytics  but I am confused as to where to store them. The team can just run  these script on their own machine but it seems clunky and it would be  hard to feed them into my ML models.

I  was thinking about a centralised system, like building a LAN server  that runs 24/7 Python scripts pulling daily data from different APIs to  feed them directly into my models, and create reports on excel which the  team can just download them. There would also be an SQL server here,  but it seems that I am the only one that knows SQL so I am the only one  that can query it.

With cloud, I  was thinking that it would be difficult to automatically process the  data especially because currently the process is pulling data from APIs  using Python scripts and that feeding them into an ML algorithm would  also be hard.

What do you think would be the best solution and is there any tips that you might have?",3,3,3,0,1,/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/,2023-01-22,2023,remaining,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/10iltbh/creating_a_brand_new_data_infrastructure_for_a/
