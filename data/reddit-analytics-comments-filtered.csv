So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

On my experience the second model delivers higher value to the company and should be implemented as soon as the squads/tribes are mature enough to demand a data person with them",2,r/analytics

You have all of these meetings and agile processes in place, yet there are core tenants that are not being implemented.

An example being if you are strictly following agile methods; they fact that you regularly don't finish a task and move it over it to the next sprint means you have a failed sprint.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz. 

When we were all assigned to different B.Us then turned irrelevant.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

It's not about the ceremonies or the rally/jira tool. You should be having regular sprint demos, soliciting feedback and iteratively work on the highest priority stuff for that increment.

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

Then as a director, if you see little hope for improvement then get rid.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

2. Second guy read a beginner SQL book. He sold his manager on running SQL reports.  His manager wouldn't have to wait for another dept to make changes.  After 6 months of running his report, he updated his resume to data analyst. He went from $16/hr to a $50k/year data analyst in the same industry.

After 8 months in that job, he left for a $80k base salary plus bonus job. He wasn't hired only for his SQL skills. He had subject matter expertise in the same industry.  It's data entry, but it still counts.

After 5 years, he is making $110k base plus bonus.

3) Third guy was heavy weed smoker. He had no motivation. He borrowed the beginner SQL book. He started running data reports for his manager.  Updated his resume from data entry to data analyst. His pay went from $16/hr to $50k/yr data analyst position in the same industry. Subject matter expertise plays a role.  He's been in the same position for 5 years.

*To do:*

1. *Study a beginner SQL book. You can check Amazon or start a post asking for recommendations. Install the free editions of software at home and start practicing. Years ago, MS SQL Server was free to download. I don't if it's changed.*
2. In a data entry position, you have intimate knowledge about the data from the front end. It helps with data reporting.

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

In the context of operations, ChatGPT is a fantastic tool to make us better.  But the widespread, rapid adoption has come with an ability to ask good questions and interpret the code.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz. 

When we were all assigned to different B.Us then turned irrelevant.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz. 

When we were all assigned to different B.Us then turned irrelevant.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.

So theres no consensus, lots of teams involved, and no goals - and you need to own it? I know thats not helpful but I wouldnt be so hand-wavey at a new hire. My expectation is new analysts are learning and minimally contributing for 1-3 months depending on experience.

Anyway, heres the steps I would take:
1. Talk to every stakeholder/team lead involved with this. Including data engineering or any other tech teams that could be involved. Find out what data they use, what metrics are important, and what they do/are responsible for

2. Prepare a doc that lists what you are going to do, with a single source of truth report being one of the key deliverables. If there are multiple ways of looking at it/multiple data sources youll never get anywhere, youll just get bogged down with why does this number not match this other number type questions.

3. Share the above doc and make sure you align with everyone (a senior leader in the org to champion this helps). Decide on metric definitions, reports, dimensions/measures, and exactly how to answer retention/engagement questions. Make sure its clear that everyone will be using your data, and your data will be considered the source of truth. Any other data is wrong and you will not reconcile it after this project completes.

4. Deliver step 3 in an automated fashion, have a few rounds of feedback and change (this is inevitable, better to mock up in Excel than waste time building a dashboard that takes longer to create). When done, send a company-wide email so everyone knows what it is and how to use it.

Obviously thats a simplification of the work involved, which I would expect to take ~1 quarter but varies with the company.

Once youve established that you own the data and definitions, then I would move to understanding what levers there are to boost retention/engagement. Then work backwards to come up with very specific, very narrowly scoped projects with rough estimates on how much improvement to expect.

With that, you can create a prioritized list based on impact and difficulty, which ideally would supply multiple quarters of work.",2,r/analytics

What worked best for my teams while a 'data analytics' team (~7 IC and 1 manager) was kanbam pull. You start a demand you go through it till the end. And all the backlog is prioritized with stakeholders (manager main responsibility), so the team knows whatever is at the top is the most important thing to do, there is no waiting to see what's next. 

We kept planning every 15 days, but if a new more urgent task showed up, there was no problem going straight to the top, but we finished whatever we started first. And once a month we held a retrospective to discuss team issues. All other ceremonies fell short on their purpose, so we stopped doing them. 

Next, we got to the same situation, where our analysts were spread across the company. In this case, we stopped the 'data team' ceremonies and each IC joined a squad/tribe and any demand was aligned directly with thata vertical manager. Managers of data teams were paired with senior leadership from that tribe/alliance

We held chapter meetings to share knowledge and keep an identity, but after a few months the analysts identified themselves more with their squad than with the chapter. And that was ok.

In the beginning it was nice to meet daily because there were so much work to be done from DE to Viz.

My point is unless its a big project and there are more people working on it then scrum will have no effect and it will be dead already

I find it especially helpful in data viz teams because it should be extremely customer focused. 

As a suggestion, rather than spend the energy attempting to change it, how about first spend that energy trying to embrace it and make it work for your team. Immerse yourself in agile and become a champion.

I don't know if this is acceptable in your culture, every country and company has its ways. Considering an upfront, transparent approach (my preferred way of dealing with problems):

First of all, in my understanding of your narrative, nobody else is aware this is an issue but you. Is it really an issue? Honest question. If it's working for everyone, maybe you have an alignment problem.

If it is a problem:

Have you talked about it with your immediate manager? What he said about it?
He was supposed to coach you on issues like this.

Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?


A few word of advice:

Your managing skills only goes up to the jr ability to grow by herself. You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times. 

Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties (company and employee). 

You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it",2,r/analytics

- Is it really an issue?

It's invisible and you're right - it's an alignment problem. Everything that is asked of anyone is done on-time. With that said, I have my own skill gaps that I desperately need to work on, and management has expressed their willingness to support this even during work hours. Unfortunately, the little time I would normally have to do this is cut into when her team has a looming deadline and she's unable to do the work. 

- Have you talked about it with your immediate manager?

Nope. He's an accountant and financial guy (former corporate controller), and much of the accounting team's work is backlogged to the point where we're over a year behind on profitability reports. There's literally no time to talk with him beyond quick questions I have about my analyses (since many of them require accounting stuff that I'm re-learning). 

**This is totally a problem. I can definitely see that**. 

- Have you given honest and constructive feedback for her? Seen any improvement from that? 

I have given honest and diplomatic feedback, both during the time that I managed her, along with the more recent time. I set reasonable, measurable expectations and if necessary, develop a plan to get there. When I was her day to day manager, she improved, and her progress was slow, but trended upward. She's not afraid to take on a challenge and she takes criticism well. Unfortunately, between her falling short so much as of late, along with the sudden and hectic nature of someone needing work done immediately, achieving those objectives takes a back seat to ""just get it done.""

- Have you told her immediate manager what's going on? What was their response?

This is where I ultimately am asking for help. I want to tread very carefully here because anything that sets her back will impact me. Aside from it reflecting poorly on me that ""I didn't prepare her enough"" (and I very well may not have), it will turn into me basically having to double up all her work, sucking away my availability to grow my career in the rest of corporate analytics. 

- What happens if you let yours and hers superiors know you will progressively step away from teaching her to focus on more critical tasks, would it still be your fault?

I think that this is probably something I need to include in a sitdown with one or both of them - whenever I can wedge one in. 


***

&gt;You shouldn't carry her by her hand till the end of times.

Agreed. I would like to work on a way to break this. It's not good for either of our careers, especially if for some reason I left. She'd be in a tough spot and I would not make myself available for any help without a hefty consulting fee. 

&gt; Sometimes it is best to let people go if this isn't goint to work in the long run. It's a waste of time for both parties.

I'm open to this, I just want to be sure that whatever communications and discussion that lead to this point don't reflect on my ability to manage. She demonstrated proficiency when I managed her. She completed entire projects by herself when I managed her. Suddenly, it's as if she has forgotten the most basic concepts and similar, or easier projects are accompanied by a slew of ""day one"" questions. 

&gt;You can start recruiting before letting her go and only pull the trigger when you have a good match. 

My ear is always to the ground. There are challenges in filling this type of position at this particular level, but we can address them as they come along. 

&gt;None of this make less hard to fire someone. It's always a traumatic process (for me at least), but both of you grow a lot out of it

Agreed. Luckily I won't be the executioner, but rather the judge and jury. I came out of a dismissal way better than I was going in.

However, if you want to learn python and integrate it in your job, I think that's always doable. You'll have to build a good use case for it because you'd be doing it on company time, but I firmly believe you can always find ways to make things more efficient. For example, find any repetitive data cleaning tasks or create automated reports for stakeholders. Find out what your stakeholders do with your data and try to streamline it.

Examples:

\- Stakeholder keeps asking you for YoY reports before going into a meeting with a client. You can suggest a weekly/monthly YoY breakdown for each client (in the form of an automated email), or create a dashboard so they can keep track of it whenever they want.

\- Consolidating multiple weekly reports (from vendors, clients, etc) into one master sheet, instead of doing it manually

[https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en)

Best bet is to run page load speed tests at regular intervals and see if anything GTM related shows up in your warnings.

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

Don't take tests like that too seriously, though. They're theoretical. My site shows average page load times at 5 seconds for every country, for example (monthly traffic at 400k+ visitors). But that speed checker says first contentful paint alone is supposed to take 11 seconds.

I wouldn't expect you to run into problems with a bunch of normal pageview and event tags. GTM loads asynchronously. Maybe a ""performance issue"" would cause some tags to fail to fire every now and then because users browse faster than they can trigger. (not set) landing pages account for 5% of all sessions instead of 1% or something.

I think the warning is really about injecting a bunch of custom code through HTML tags or JS variables. I'm sure one could do something using those means that would crust up a user's browser for honk up tag firing or variable pop orders or something.

Data Entry, 9 times of out 10, can be automated. You're usually repeating the same process again and again, on a schedule. 

Step 1: Learn how to cut down your job time in half. This is not challenging.   
Understand how the data is entered and learn to build processes and schedules to do them automatically.   
If sometime takes you 4 hours, you can work on getting it done in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Keep this under wraps. You don't want your colleagues to know that you reduced your output time, for a myriad of reasons.   
For one, it's your benefit to enjoy. For another, you may get more work on your plate.   
And the one that has actually happened to me is that other co-workers can't do it as well as you, and they will resent you. I used to finish my data entry work, which took other co-workers a day, in under 2 hours. And I was proud of it until they took me aside and told me to stick to the status quo. Cause they don't want me to raise the bar.  


Step 3: 

Understand how the analytics team in your company works. Now that you have extra time, see where your data is going. Spend time with analytics, and ask them to share some reports that they generate.   
Ask them what tools they use. Maybe there are some tutorials or orientation material they can pass onto you. Find a mentor, someone who can answer your questions when you have them. Again, keep this under wraps, mainly because you want to present it to managers once you're confident.  


Step 4: STUDY  
This is the longest part, but you really have to just study and learn.   
learn a lot about how the tools work, and how analytical logic works. Its fun, but its also a lot of self-study and figuring things out. This is where the mentor comes in.  


Step 5:   
Apply for an internal transfer. You can look for open positions in the analytics team, and see if you can transfer internally. This is usually the easiest.   
And once they interview you, you can show them how you automated the data entry process, how you learned all the analytics and tools yourself, and how you are passionate about this role.   
Even if they don't hire you/ there are no openings, you can apply externally since you have this skillset.  


Its very do-able, but will take a lot of work and dedication. Good Luck!",6,r/analytics

Medium size companies (less than 10k employees) are more likely  to provide database access to employees in other departments. Volunteer to run your manager's monthly reports. It may only require a date change for the new month end.
3. If there are data analysts in your building, make friends with one of them. Hang out at lunch with them. Ask them for help on SQL projects.
4. Update your resume to data analyst position, if you are comfortable with creating new reports with more than one table.  Ask the data analyst friend review your resume. They know what's important for beginner role.",13,r/analytics

You should be looking at rates of satisfaction (% satisfied) not counts of satisfaction, which it sounds like you currently are? So the number of respondents should not affect the interpretation - you solve this by looking at rates not numbers.

However, I would DEFINITELY be doing some stats on this. 17 and 25 respondents are miniscule sample sizes - its quite unlikely you can discern anything meaningful from a YOY analysis with such numbers. I doubt anything less than a 20 point change would be statistically significant.

In short - I would question the value of the YOY analysis at this stage, a qualitative review would probably be better. But you definitely want to do the stats, as otherwise you are highly likely to start inferring meaning into noise in the data.

Biggest benefits:  
Junior engineers are going to need to come with critical thinking skills, people skills, flexibility, and a drive to keep learning about business processes.  They are analysts with deeper skills.  They still need to understand how to ask the questions to get to the proper answers that fit the enterprise architecture and the business cases.  
Some downside:
However, this shift eventually could be distressing in unexpected ways, particularly when selecting this field of work.

Curbal has a good YouTube channel and guy in a cube as well. 

If you are straight finance, like in an accounting firm, there are very specific models in excel you have to use and cannot deviate from, so powerbi would not really be worth it. Check out the financial modeling World Cup for examples of that. 

If your role is more of a data analyst and other people in your firm use power bi, I would pick it up as it is a useful skill and fun when you get the hang of it. 

If it is just you by yourself, I would keep everything in excel. I have made the mistake of starting someplace, putting everything into a power bi data model, but the people just wanting the raw data instead of the viz I created. 

So depends on if you are a data analyst vs a straight pro forma guy, and if you have a company database or if everything is just in excel files on a sharepoint server, and if you are a one man band vs a larger company.

Being able to publish a PBI file to PBI Online is one of the biggest advantages. There's more to this than just sharing. You can have your dataset on the cloud and have PBI crunch the data for you.

First of all validated data means the data has been cleaned up and tested as usable data. The data has been formatted and standardized. Extra spaces, unnecessary punctuation, and duplicates have be removed. The data types are what they are supposed to be. And if there are certain minimum and maximum values, the data should fall within those maximum and/or minimum values.

Let's say you have an Excel file with 5 columns: sales date, recording date, sales id, customer name, and sales price. You can use the value function on each column. This will tell you what kind of data type is recorded. Data types should be the same for each column. Any anomalies should be either removed or placed in their correct column. Next you want to check if the dates of sales and recording are actually in date formats and not reading as strings, integers, text, etc.  Next make sure that your dates all follow the correct format. The US' short date format is MM/DD/YYYY and the rest of the world's short date is DD/MM/YYYY. There are functions called, month, date, and year that you can apply to each column to check. And pick one date format for the entire set of data. In this case, a recording date would be on or after the sales date. You can set a function to check if the recording date is on or after the sales date using the validation function on the data ribbon and set the recording date to be equal or greater than the sales date. Make sure the sales ID is a string. If it's an integer or date, it could behave strangely when you do analysis on it. Next check if your customer names all follow the same format and if you are missing their last name or first name, you might want to check if it's in other data sources or make some kind of notation to either remove or explain why there's a data anomaly. And finally make sure that the sales price is in currency and make sure that your currency format and type is correct. Imagine what would happen if you didn't convert JPY, VND or INR to USD or EUR? You would have some overinflated values.

Next look up the trim, clean, and substitute functions. Those should remove extra spaces, unreadable characters and can be used to modify or remove bad data in the columns.

There is also a remove duplicates function on the data ribbon. You should use this after cleaning up your data. Finally create pivot tables to check what values are in your rows. If anything looks wrong, you can use find the find function to find the anomalous value and then you can apply the necessary corrections.

My response is by no means the only way of cleansing and validating your data. Nor is it complete but it should kind of give you an idea of what it means to validate your data.

Good luck.",2,r/analytics

Even if its not a metric youre going to use in your analysis it still proves youre working off the same information.

Second option - For each column in your data can you look at a something like a max/min/average/counts/unique counts or distribution and check that it doesnt seem odd.

Some things Ive seen pop up doing data validation this way:

* Specific days/months/years missing.

* Duplicate unique IDs

* Whole columns null/zero

* Max or min values outside reality, like negative numbers of employees or average customer age of 107yrs.",3,r/analytics

Personally, I would lean towards working like so:

1. If you ever have a form, it should be a ""fix request"" to prioritize bug fixes and non-critical concerns. Especially if you own a very large reporting environment that may need to juggle problems relative to staff.
2. However, for larger requests you should personally sit down with the customer, discuss their needs, and send a bulleted summary of the conversation with the stakeholder.

Now, when you meet your customer you should make sure to outline a high-level business context, a specification list(based upon a guided conversation with your customer), and a timeline you've (broadly) agreed on. And of course, keep your stakeholders up to date as much as possible. (ideally personal emails on task-timelines; potentially a shared project tracker with reminder messages)

If you use a more standardized charter, the risk is that this comes off as impersonal, and you typically want people to feel like you're personal, likeable, and care.

In my experience, this is a very common issue, or challenge all orgs and analysts need to figure out. The problem is, a HUGE part of effectively defining requirements is a soft skill that takes practice and experience. Being able to ask really good questions to the stakeholder, taking their responses, clarifying as much as you can and interpreting what their saying, before moving on. 

Validation, validation, validation. 
My old org placed a huge emphasis on validation at every step. 

Wed have a couple initial meetings to define requirements, write out a nice formal looking document and go over that with the stakeholder, get their sign off and then move onto building a prototype/template. 

Meet with the stakeholder again, go over the prototype along with the requirements documentation, get their sign off at that state, and then begin developing. 

Develop kind of a minimum viable product, meet with the stakeholder again, get them to sign off, then develop the final product. 

After you develop the finished product, a good demo and hand off of the project is really really important. In that meeting, recap the project, make sure to emphasis the validation and sign off you got from them at every step. Then show the finished product, demonstrate how it answers all their requirements etc. 

If you do that, youve done your job. After the project is finished and the user still wants to make a lot of changes or updates, they need to know that their changes werent within the original scope of work, and if they want more, it will have to be considered another project.

Also, look at the people currently working there on LinkedIn. If they dont have impressive backgrounds thats a bit concerning. If youre the most experienced analytics professional and youre not being hired for a senior role, I would also guess its more of a reporting role.

Try to find out who your boss is, and think about whether that person can teach you things. Someone without analytics experience may not be able to help you grow. If youre in an early/mid career level this is extremely important for developing skills.

Finally, think about the business itself. Does it actually lend itself to using analytics? So for instance, marketing-driven companies need analysis for all sorts of things.

I proved that our customer LTV curves are long tailed and grow consistently out to 12+ months on average - many customers kept paying much longer, but the average was a year or more. But the customers did have a slow ramp up of 2-4 weeks while they got used to the product, during which time spend was low.

My recommendation was to increase our ad bids because we were acquiring customers very profitability when looking at it from an LTV perspective. The CEO and other leaders continued to do marketing expecting a repayment period of ~1 month, which made no sense given the product and customer spending curves.

My recommendation went unheeded, and I could see analytics wasnt driving business decisions. So I left. And a few months later, in a surprise to many (but not me), the company had to lay off something like 40% of their employees.

If they had followed my advice they could have had a lot more customers providing daily revenue. Maybe it wouldnt have been enough to prevent the layoffs, but it wouldnt have hurt.

There are lots of things that are being used that VBA would traditionally be used for. A few examples include PowerQuery (for data transformation) and python (for general automation.) Microsoft is also shifting to JavaScript based APIs (e.g. Office Scripts). These new APIs are cross-platform and work in Excel for Windows, Mac, and Online. And that will be what many people will likely learn going forward. In terms of just VBA development within Excel, Microsoft is actively blocking macros in Excel files that originated from the internet (e.g. from an email) for security reasons. So the writing is on the wall for VBA. 

Many pure VBA developers, at least in the US, are now in their 40s to 50s or older. And I think that many of them are just hoping that they can stick with the language until they retire. I would not recommend investing in learning the language heavily.

The reason, in my opinion, is that VBA usually replaces a broken manual process with a broken automated process. 

There are a very large number of companies, however, still using legacy systems and outdated processes where VBA can seriously increase efficiency on the short to mid-term. Even in these cases, VBA automations are usually not scalable at all and become very hard to maintain quickly.

All in all, learn it if your company can benefit from it now (if learning it doesn't require a large effort from your side) because of the above-mentioned reasons.
