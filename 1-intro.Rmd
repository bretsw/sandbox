# `r fa("fab fa-r-project", fill = "#fff")` Getting Started with RStudio

Activities:  

1. Running a single RMarkdown chunk  
1. Running another RMarkdown chunk  
1. Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  
1. Creating your first visualization

---

# `r fa("fab fa-r-project", fill = "#fff")` RMarkdown

- RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
- It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
- It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)
